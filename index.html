<h1>YEAR 7 MARVEL</h1>
<div>Marvel is a classic whether its in movies or comics it can bring back so much nostalgia.
  From 1939 till now.
  It is famous worldwide and interesting story and lore surrounding the characters.
  For example spiderman the face of marvel(my opinion)a young teenager saving the world every day.
  Then there is Iron man who is a rich billionaire who has a multi billion dollar suit that fires guns and missles.
  As well as other heroes who contribute to saving the world as well.All have faced hardships and then overcome them.
  Stan Lee(creator of marvel)has unfortunately passed away but marvel did not and it will hopefully continue.
  At the moment there are currently a few movies and series being produced.   
  Over the 83 years they have made millions if not billions of dollars and they are still making more for us fans. </div>
